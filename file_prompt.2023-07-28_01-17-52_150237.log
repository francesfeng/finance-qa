2023-07-28 02:08:57.373 | LLM      | src.models.agents:query_text_table:52 - Query: What are the outlook for PEM technology? | Processing Time: 4.644473917083815 | Response: Based on the provided text, the outlook for PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane) technology is not very positive. The text mentions that alkaline electrolyser technology, which is a rival technology platform, may outflank PEM technology. Alkaline technology is said to have lower upfront costs and ITM (presumably a company or technology) is exclusively leveraged to PEM. Additionally, there is increasing competition within the PEM technology itself, making it difficult for ITM to capture meaningful market share. The estimate is that PEM technology will have around 5% of the total electrolyser market and approximately 15% of the PEM market share.
