The UK will host the UN COP 26 in Glasgow in November this year, and in this note we highlight potential policy catalysts for green hydrogen leading up to and during COP 26. We highlight the UK’s recently published Hydrogen Strategy which will inform the UK’s hydrogen policy initiatives going forward. We also assess the US’s hydrogen policy thrust given the Biden administration has been more receptive towards clean hydrogen compared to previous administrations. Germany goes to elections on Sunday and we believe the results of these elections on September 26 will likely help crystallise momentum around Germany’s hydrogen policy. The EU’s Fit-for-55 laid out the continental-bloc’s broad decarbonisation framework and the market awaits further policy details. Overall, we expect new electrolyser capacity targets, more policy details around fiscal incentives, and details around the creation of a tradable hydrogen market across countries.  Even the classification criteria for what exactly constitutes standard green/blue/pink hydrogen should help further the development of a well-functioning hydrogen market. Some of the policy initiatives we highlight in this note are not completely new, but we believe that the advent of COP 26 should help refresh some of these important market issues in the minds of investors.', 'metadata': {'source': <Source.equity_research: 'equity_research'>, 'type': <Type.pdf: 'pdf'>, 'publisher': 'Citi', 'url': 'https://www.citivelocity.com/rendition/eppublic/documentService/ZG9jX2lkPTMwMDM5NjY2JmNoYW5uZWw9RU1BSUxfTU9OSVRPUklORyZzdWItY2hhbm5lbD1FbWFpbCZwbGF0Zm9ybT00Ng', 'created_at': '1632441600.0', 'author': 'P.J.

The UK will host the UN COP 26 in Glasgow in November this year, and in this note we highlight potential policy catalysts for green hydrogen leading up to and during COP 26. We highlight the UK’s recently published Hydrogen Strategy which will inform the UK’s hydrogen policy initiatives going forward. We also assess the US’s hydrogen policy thrust given the Biden administration has been more receptive towards clean hydrogen compared to previous administrations. Germany goes to elections on Sunday and we believe the results of these elections on September 26 will likely help crystallise momentum around Germany’s hydrogen policy. The EU’s Fit-for-55 laid out the continental-bloc’s broad decarbonisation framework and the market awaits further policy details. Overall, we expect new electrolyser capacity targets, more policy details around fiscal incentives, and details around the creation of a tradable hydrogen market across countries.  Even the classification criteria for what exactly constitutes standard green/blue/pink hydrogen should help further the development of a well-functioning hydrogen market.

The UK will host the UN COP 26 in Glasgow in November this year, and in this note we highlight potential policy catalysts for green hydrogen leading up to and during COP 26. We highlight the UK’s recently published Hydrogen Strategy which will inform the UK’s hydrogen policy initiatives going forward. We also assess the US’s hydrogen policy thrust given the Biden administration has been more receptive towards clean hydrogen compared to previous administrations. Germany goes to elections on Sunday and we believe the results of these elections on September 26 will likely help crystallise momentum around Germany’s hydrogen policy. The EU’s Fit-for-55 laid out the continental-bloc’s broad decarbonisation framework and the market awaits further policy details. Overall, we expect new electrolyser capacity targets, more policy details around fiscal incentives, and details around the creation of a tradable hydrogen market across countries.  Even the classification criteria for what exactly constitutes standard green/blue/pink hydrogen should help further the development of a well-functioning hydrogen market.

Addressing the sceptics’ view\n\n|Topic|Sceptics' view|Citi view|\n|---|---|---|\n|Haven’t we been here before?|Hydrogen has been touted as the fuel of the future multiple times over the last century, but has never taken off in any significant way. What's different this time?|Significant support from government policy, notably the EU target for 80GW of electrolyser capacity by 2030, points to government backing that has not previously been in place. Significant investment have also been announced in other regions|\n|Aren't costs prohibitive?|Green hydrogen costs at US$3-6kg+ are prohibitive, blue hydrogen (using carbon capture) can be half this price but still not yet cost competitive with grey (unabated fossil fuel derived) hydrogen at ~US$1-2/kg\nGreen hydrogen costs are already 50% down since 2015, and cheaper renewables pricing and falling electrolyser costs, driven by volumes, should drive costs lower. The EC targets a price of €1-2/kg by 2030. The history of other technologies (wind, solar) show that the combination of higher volumes and government incentives can drive costs down faster than is often expected at the outset. A Hydrogen council report estimates that green hydrogen could be cost competitive with grey hydrogen by 2030|\n|If power prices need to fall significantly, who will invest in the renewable power infrastructure?|Since electricity is the major cost component of green hydrogen, cheap (or free) electricity will be needed to drive down the price of green hydrogen, removing the incentive to invest in the required wind and solar in the first place\nRenewables costs are falling already - Iberdrola sees onshore wind LCOE down 30% and offshore LCOE down 40% by 2030 – and other drivers like falling electrolyser costs (which we see down 60% by 2030) and higher system efficiency also play a role. Hydrogen Europe sees green hydrogen at €1-2/kg possible at power prices of €15-30/MWh. Areas with the cheapest renewable resources (US, Australia, Middle East) have significant cost advantages for hydrogen production compared to regions like Japan or South Korea|\n|What about the infrastructure?|Transportation and storage costs are prohibitive for anything other than on-site hydrogen production|Hydrogen could share the existing natural gas network to some extent. Small scale transportation by truck is already viable for niche applications. For long-distance, the first liquefied hydrogen carrier ship was launched in 2019|\n|If renewable power prices are falling, isn’t electrification better?|Direct electrification using renewable power has lower system losses than power-to-hydrogen-to-power|We see green hydrogen being used primarily in harder to abate sectors, not as an alternative to electrification|\n|Aren't batteries better?|Batteries are a cheaper alternative for electrification, and auto companies seem to be mainly backing batteries, not hydrogen. Elon Musk’s “Fool cells” remark is widely quoted|We see hydrogen as being most successful where batteries are not viable; Citi's auto team, for example, do not expect passenger cars to be a major end market for hydrogen, and this is not a major driver of our thesis. Hydrogen costs are falling, however, and in certain applications (long-distance transportation or where short recharge/refuel times are needed), hydrogen has significant advantages over battery technology, and is already being adopted in niche areas like forklift trucks and distributed power gen in data centres|\n|What about policy risk?|Green hydrogen is not currently economically viable, and without policy support investment could collapse|We’ve seen other markets develop this way, for example in solar and wind. Policy-driven markets have different risks than typical supply/demand, but can still be a success|", 'metadata': {'source': <Source.equity_research: 'equity_research'>, 'type': <Type.table: 'table'>, 'publisher': 'Citi Research', 'url': 'process/process_pdf_tables/data/test.pdf/5', 'created_at': '1600214400.0', 'author': None, 'title': 'Figure 1.

Thus it is difficult to distinguish between what extra capacity will be built because of the development of hydrogen versus what would have gone ahead anyway. One way to estimate this effect is to look at what is required to meet the EU's 2030 target for electrolysis capacity of 40 GW.\n\nAssuming that 67% of the extra electricity needed to power these electrolysers will come from offshore wind, as opposed to other renewables such as solar in Spain, we estimate that this plan will require around 21 GW of offshore wind over the next decade. As the technology matures over time, this is likely to be relatively back-end loaded.

Addressing the sceptics’ view\n\n|Topic|Sceptics' view|Citi view|\n|---|---|---|\n|Haven’t we been here before?|Hydrogen has been touted as the fuel of the future multiple times over the last century, but has never taken off in any significant way. What's different this time?|Significant support from government policy, notably the EU target for 80GW of electrolyser capacity by 2030, points to government backing that has not previously been in place. Significant investment have also been announced in other regions|\n|Aren't costs prohibitive?|Green hydrogen costs at US$3-6kg+ are prohibitive, blue hydrogen (using carbon capture) can be half this price but still not yet cost competitive with grey (unabated fossil fuel derived) hydrogen at ~US$1-2/kg\nGreen hydrogen costs are already 50% down since 2015, and cheaper renewables pricing and falling electrolyser costs, driven by volumes, should drive costs lower. The EC targets a price of €1-2/kg by 2030. The history of other technologies (wind, solar) show that the combination of higher volumes and government incentives can drive costs down faster than is often expected at the outset. A Hydrogen council report estimates that green hydrogen could be cost competitive with grey hydrogen by 2030|\n|If power prices need to fall significantly, who will invest in the renewable power infrastructure?|Since electricity is the major cost component of green hydrogen, cheap (or free) electricity will be needed to drive down the price of green hydrogen, removing the incentive to invest in the required wind and solar in the first place\nRenewables costs are falling already - Iberdrola sees onshore wind LCOE down 30% and offshore LCOE down 40% by 2030 – and other drivers like falling electrolyser costs (which we see down 60% by 2030) and higher system efficiency also play a role. Hydrogen Europe sees green hydrogen at €1-2/kg possible at power prices of €15-30/MWh. Areas with the cheapest renewable resources (US, Australia, Middle East) have significant cost advantages for hydrogen production compared to regions like Japan or South Korea|\n|What about the infrastructure?|Transportation and storage costs are prohibitive for anything other than on-site hydrogen production|Hydrogen could share the existing natural gas network to some extent. Small scale transportation by truck is already viable for niche applications. For long-distance, the first liquefied hydrogen carrier ship was launched in 2019|\n|If renewable power prices are falling, isn’t electrification better?|Direct electrification using renewable power has lower system losses than power-to-hydrogen-to-power|We see green hydrogen being used primarily in harder to abate sectors, not as an alternative to electrification|\n|Aren't batteries better?|Batteries are a cheaper alternative for electrification, and auto companies seem to be mainly backing batteries, not hydrogen. Elon Musk’s “Fool cells” remark is widely quoted|We see hydrogen as being most successful where batteries are not viable; Citi's auto team, for example, do not expect passenger cars to be a major end market for hydrogen, and this is not a major driver of our thesis. Hydrogen costs are falling, however, and in certain applications (long-distance transportation or where short recharge/refuel times are needed), hydrogen has significant advantages over battery technology, and is already being adopted in niche areas like forklift trucks and distributed power gen in data centres|\n|What about policy risk?|Green hydrogen is not currently economically viable, and without policy support investment could collapse|We’ve seen other markets develop this way, for example in solar and wind.

Thus it is difficult to distinguish between what extra capacity will be built because of the development of hydrogen versus what would have gone ahead anyway. One way to estimate this effect is to look at what is required to meet the EU's 2030 target for electrolysis capacity of 40 GW.\n\nAssuming that 67% of the extra electricity needed to power these electrolysers will come from offshore wind, as opposed to other renewables such as solar in Spain, we estimate that this plan will require around 21 GW of offshore wind over the next decade.

Addressing the sceptics’ view\n\n|Topic|Sceptics' view|Citi view|\n|---|---|---|\n|Haven’t we been here before?|Hydrogen has been touted as the fuel of the future multiple times over the last century, but has never taken off in any significant way. What's different this time?|Significant support from government policy, notably the EU target for 80GW of electrolyser capacity by 2030, points to government backing that has not previously been in place. Significant investment have also been announced in other regions|\n|Aren't costs prohibitive?|Green hydrogen costs at US$3-6kg+ are prohibitive, blue hydrogen (using carbon capture) can be half this price but still not yet cost competitive with grey (unabated fossil fuel derived) hydrogen at ~US$1-2/kg\nGreen hydrogen costs are already 50% down since 2015, and cheaper renewables pricing and falling electrolyser costs, driven by volumes, should drive costs lower. The EC targets a price of €1-2/kg by 2030. The history of other technologies (wind, solar) show that the combination of higher volumes and government incentives can drive costs down faster than is often expected at the outset. A Hydrogen council report estimates that green hydrogen could be cost competitive with grey hydrogen by 2030|\n|If power prices need to fall significantly, who will invest in the renewable power infrastructure?|Since electricity is the major cost component of green hydrogen, cheap (or free) electricity will be needed to drive down the price of green hydrogen, removing the incentive to invest in the required wind and solar in the first place\nRenewables costs are falling already - Iberdrola sees onshore wind LCOE down 30% and offshore LCOE down 40% by 2030 – and other drivers like falling electrolyser costs (which we see down 60% by 2030) and higher system efficiency also play a role. Hydrogen Europe sees green hydrogen at €1-2/kg possible at power prices of €15-30/MWh. Areas with the cheapest renewable resources (US, Australia, Middle East) have significant cost advantages for hydrogen production compared to regions like Japan or South Korea|\n|What about the infrastructure?|Transportation and storage costs are prohibitive for anything other than on-site hydrogen production|Hydrogen could share the existing natural gas network to some extent. Small scale transportation by truck is already viable for niche applications. For long-distance, the first liquefied hydrogen carrier ship was launched in 2019|\n|If renewable power prices are falling, isn’t electrification better?|Direct electrification using renewable power has lower system losses than power-to-hydrogen-to-power|We see green hydrogen being used primarily in harder to abate sectors, not as an alternative to electrification|\n|Aren't batteries better?|Batteries are a cheaper alternative for electrification, and auto companies seem to be mainly backing batteries, not hydrogen. Elon Musk’s “Fool cells” remark is widely quoted|We see hydrogen as being most successful where batteries are not viable; Citi's auto team, for example, do not expect passenger cars to be a major end market for hydrogen, and this is not a major driver of our thesis. Hydrogen costs are falling, however, and in certain applications (long-distance transportation or where short recharge/refuel times are needed), hydrogen has significant advantages over battery technology, and is already being adopted in niche areas like forklift trucks and distributed power gen in data centres|\n|What about policy risk?|Green hydrogen is not currently economically viable, and without policy support investment could collapse|We’ve seen other markets develop this way, for example in solar and wind. Policy-driven markets have different risks than typical supply/demand, but can still be a success|", 'metadata': {'source': <Source.equity_research: 'equity_research'>, 'type': <Type.table: 'table'>, 'publisher': 'Citi Research', 'url': 'process/process_pdf_tables/data/test.pdf/5', 'created_at': '1600214400.0', 'author': None, 'title': 'Figure 1.

Hydrogen costs are falling, however, and in certain applications (long-distance transportation or where short recharge/refuel times are needed), hydrogen has significant advantages over battery technology, and is already being adopted in niche areas like forklift trucks and distributed power gen in data centres|\n|What about policy risk?|Green hydrogen is not currently economically viable, and without policy support investment could collapse|We’ve seen other markets develop this way, for example in solar and wind.

We highlight the UK’s recently published Hydrogen Strategy which will inform the UK’s hydrogen policy initiatives going forward. We also assess the US’s hydrogen policy thrust given the Biden administration has been more receptive towards clean hydrogen compared to previous administrations. Germany goes to elections on Sunday and we believe the results of these elections on September 26 will likely help crystallise momentum around Germany’s hydrogen policy. The EU’s Fit-for-55 laid out the continental-bloc’s broad decarbonisation framework and the market awaits further policy details. Overall, we expect new electrolyser capacity targets, more policy details around fiscal incentives, and details around the creation of a tradable hydrogen market across countries.  Even the classification criteria for what exactly constitutes standard green/blue/pink hydrogen should help further the development of a well-functioning hydrogen market.

Addressing the sceptics’ view\n\n|Topic|Sceptics' view|Citi view|\n|---|---|---|\n|Haven’t we been here before?|Hydrogen has been touted as the fuel of the future multiple times over the last century, but has never taken off in any significant way. What's different this time?|Significant support from government policy, notably the EU target for 80GW of electrolyser capacity by 2030, points to government backing that has not previously been in place. Significant investment have also been announced in other regions|\n|Aren't costs prohibitive?|Green hydrogen costs at US$3-6kg+ are prohibitive, blue hydrogen (using carbon capture) can be half this price but still not yet cost competitive with grey (unabated fossil fuel derived) hydrogen at ~US$1-2/kg\nGreen hydrogen costs are already 50% down since 2015, and cheaper renewables pricing and falling electrolyser costs, driven by volumes, should drive costs lower. The EC targets a price of €1-2/kg by 2030. The history of other technologies (wind, solar) show that the combination of higher volumes and government incentives can drive costs down faster than is often expected at the outset. A Hydrogen council report estimates that green hydrogen could be cost competitive with grey hydrogen by 2030|\n|If power prices need to fall significantly, who will invest in the renewable power infrastructure?|Since electricity is the major cost component of green hydrogen, cheap (or free) electricity will be needed to drive down the price of green hydrogen, removing the incentive to invest in the required wind and solar in the first place\nRenewables costs are falling already - Iberdrola sees onshore wind LCOE down 30% and offshore LCOE down 40% by 2030 – and other drivers like falling electrolyser costs (which we see down 60% by 2030) and higher system efficiency also play a role. Hydrogen Europe sees green hydrogen at €1-2/kg possible at power prices of €15-30/MWh. Areas with the cheapest renewable resources (US, Australia, Middle East) have significant cost advantages for hydrogen production compared to regions like Japan or South Korea|\n|What about the infrastructure?|Transportation and storage costs are prohibitive for anything other than on-site hydrogen production|Hydrogen could share the existing natural gas network to some extent. Small scale transportation by truck is already viable for niche applications. For long-distance, the first liquefied hydrogen carrier ship was launched in 2019|\n|If renewable power prices are falling, isn’t electrification better?|Direct electrification using renewable power has lower system losses than power-to-hydrogen-to-power|We see green hydrogen being used primarily in harder to abate sectors, not as an alternative to electrification|\n|Aren't batteries better?|Batteries are a cheaper alternative for electrification, and auto companies seem to be mainly backing batteries, not hydrogen. Elon Musk’s “Fool cells” remark is widely quoted|We see hydrogen as being most successful where batteries are not viable; Citi's auto team, for example, do not expect passenger cars to be a major end market for hydrogen, and this is not a major driver of our thesis. Hydrogen costs are falling, however, and in certain applications (long-distance transportation or where short recharge/refuel times are needed), hydrogen has significant advantages over battery technology, and is already being adopted in niche areas like forklift trucks and distributed power gen in data centres|\n|What about policy risk?|Green hydrogen is not currently economically viable, and without policy support investment could collapse|We’ve seen other markets develop this way, for example in solar and wind.

Addressing the sceptics’ view\n\n|Topic|Sceptics' view|Citi view|\n|---|---|---|\n|Haven’t we been here before?|Hydrogen has been touted as the fuel of the future multiple times over the last century, but has never taken off in any significant way. What's different this time?|Significant support from government policy, notably the EU target for 80GW of electrolyser capacity by 2030, points to government backing that has not previously been in place. Significant investment have also been announced in other regions|\n|Aren't costs prohibitive?|Green hydrogen costs at US$3-6kg+ are prohibitive, blue hydrogen (using carbon capture) can be half this price but still not yet cost competitive with grey (unabated fossil fuel derived) hydrogen at ~US$1-2/kg\nGreen hydrogen costs are already 50% down since 2015, and cheaper renewables pricing and falling electrolyser costs, driven by volumes, should drive costs lower. The EC targets a price of €1-2/kg by 2030. The history of other technologies (wind, solar) show that the combination of higher volumes and government incentives can drive costs down faster than is often expected at the outset. A Hydrogen council report estimates that green hydrogen could be cost competitive with grey hydrogen by 2030|\n|If power prices need to fall significantly, who will invest in the renewable power infrastructure?|Since electricity is the major cost component of green hydrogen, cheap (or free) electricity will be needed to drive down the price of green hydrogen, removing the incentive to invest in the required wind and solar in the first place\nRenewables costs are falling already - Iberdrola sees onshore wind LCOE down 30% and offshore LCOE down 40% by 2030 – and other drivers like falling electrolyser costs (which we see down 60% by 2030) and higher system efficiency also play a role. Hydrogen Europe sees green hydrogen at €1-2/kg possible at power prices of €15-30/MWh. Areas with the cheapest renewable resources (US, Australia, Middle East) have significant cost advantages for hydrogen production compared to regions like Japan or South Korea|\n|What about the infrastructure?|Transportation and storage costs are prohibitive for anything other than on-site hydrogen production|Hydrogen could share the existing natural gas network to some extent. Small scale transportation by truck is already viable for niche applications. For long-distance, the first liquefied hydrogen carrier ship was launched in 2019|\n|If renewable power prices are falling, isn’t electrification better?|Direct electrification using renewable power has lower system losses than power-to-hydrogen-to-power|We see green hydrogen being used primarily in harder to abate sectors, not as an alternative to electrification|\n|Aren't batteries better?|Batteries are a cheaper alternative for electrification, and auto companies seem to be mainly backing batteries, not hydrogen. Elon Musk’s “Fool cells” remark is widely quoted|We see hydrogen as being most successful where batteries are not viable; Citi's auto team, for example, do not expect passenger cars to be a major end market for hydrogen, and this is not a major driver of our thesis. Hydrogen costs are falling, however, and in certain applications (long-distance transportation or where short recharge/refuel times are needed), hydrogen has significant advantages over battery technology, and is already being adopted in niche areas like forklift trucks and distributed power gen in data centres|\n|What about policy risk?|Green hydrogen is not currently economically viable, and without policy support investment could collapse|We’ve seen other markets develop this way, for example in solar and wind. Policy-driven markets have different risks than typical supply/demand, but can still be a success|", 'metadata': {'source': <Source.equity_research: 'equity_research'>, 'type': <Type.table: 'table'>, 'publisher': 'Citi Research', 'url': 'process/process_pdf_tables/data/test.pdf/5', 'created_at': '1600214400.0', 'author': None, 'title': 'Figure 1.

What's different this time?|Significant support from government policy, notably the EU target for 80GW of electrolyser capacity by 2030, points to government backing that has not previously been in place. Significant investment have also been announced in other regions|\n|Aren't costs prohibitive?|Green hydrogen costs at US$3-6kg+ are prohibitive, blue hydrogen (using carbon capture) can be half this price but still not yet cost competitive with grey (unabated fossil fuel derived) hydrogen at ~US$1-2/kg\nGreen hydrogen costs are already 50% down since 2015, and cheaper renewables pricing and falling electrolyser costs, driven by volumes, should drive costs lower. The EC targets a price of €1-2/kg by 2030. The history of other technologies (wind, solar) show that the combination of higher volumes and government incentives can drive costs down faster than is often expected at the outset. A Hydrogen council report estimates that green hydrogen could be cost competitive with grey hydrogen by 2030|\n|If power prices need to fall significantly, who will invest in the renewable power infrastructure?|Since electricity is the major cost component of green hydrogen, cheap (or free) electricity will be needed to drive down the price of green hydrogen, removing the incentive to invest in the required wind and solar in the first place\nRenewables costs are falling already - Iberdrola sees onshore wind LCOE down 30% and offshore LCOE down 40% by 2030 – and other drivers like falling electrolyser costs (which we see down 60% by 2030) and higher system efficiency also play a role. Hydrogen Europe sees green hydrogen at €1-2/kg possible at power prices of €15-30/MWh. Areas with the cheapest renewable resources (US, Australia, Middle East) have significant cost advantages for hydrogen production compared to regions like Japan or South Korea|\n|What about the infrastructure?|Transportation and storage costs are prohibitive for anything other than on-site hydrogen production|Hydrogen could share the existing natural gas network to some extent. Small scale transportation by truck is already viable for niche applications. For long-distance, the first liquefied hydrogen carrier ship was launched in 2019|\n|If renewable power prices are falling, isn’t electrification better?|Direct electrification using renewable power has lower system losses than power-to-hydrogen-to-power|We see green hydrogen being used primarily in harder to abate sectors, not as an alternative to electrification|\n|Aren't batteries better?|Batteries are a cheaper alternative for electrification, and auto companies seem to be mainly backing batteries, not hydrogen. Elon Musk’s “Fool cells” remark is widely quoted|We see hydrogen as being most successful where batteries are not viable; Citi's auto team, for example, do not expect passenger cars to be a major end market for hydrogen, and this is not a major driver of our thesis. Hydrogen costs are falling, however, and in certain applications (long-distance transportation or where short recharge/refuel times are needed), hydrogen has significant advantages over battery technology, and is already being adopted in niche areas like forklift trucks and distributed power gen in data centres|\n|What about policy risk?|Green hydrogen is not currently economically viable, and without policy support investment could collapse|We’ve seen other markets develop this way, for example in solar and wind.

Addressing the sceptics’ view\n\n|Topic|Sceptics' view|Citi view|\n|---|---|---|\n|Haven’t we been here before?|Hydrogen has been touted as the fuel of the future multiple times over the last century, but has never taken off in any significant way. What's different this time?|Significant support from government policy, notably the EU target for 80GW of electrolyser capacity by 2030, points to government backing that has not previously been in place. Significant investment have also been announced in other regions|\n|Aren't costs prohibitive?|Green hydrogen costs at US$3-6kg+ are prohibitive, blue hydrogen (using carbon capture) can be half this price but still not yet cost competitive with grey (unabated fossil fuel derived) hydrogen at ~US$1-2/kg\nGreen hydrogen costs are already 50% down since 2015, and cheaper renewables pricing and falling electrolyser costs, driven by volumes, should drive costs lower. The EC targets a price of €1-2/kg by 2030. The history of other technologies (wind, solar) show that the combination of higher volumes and government incentives can drive costs down faster than is often expected at the outset. A Hydrogen council report estimates that green hydrogen could be cost competitive with grey hydrogen by 2030|\n|If power prices need to fall significantly, who will invest in the renewable power infrastructure?|Since electricity is the major cost component of green hydrogen, cheap (or free) electricity will be needed to drive down the price of green hydrogen, removing the incentive to invest in the required wind and solar in the first place\nRenewables costs are falling already - Iberdrola sees onshore wind LCOE down 30% and offshore LCOE down 40% by 2030 – and other drivers like falling electrolyser costs (which we see down 60% by 2030) and higher system efficiency also play a role. Hydrogen Europe sees green hydrogen at €1-2/kg possible at power prices of €15-30/MWh. Areas with the cheapest renewable resources (US, Australia, Middle East) have significant cost advantages for hydrogen production compared to regions like Japan or South Korea|\n|What about the infrastructure?|Transportation and storage costs are prohibitive for anything other than on-site hydrogen production|Hydrogen could share the existing natural gas network to some extent. Small scale transportation by truck is already viable for niche applications. For long-distance, the first liquefied hydrogen carrier ship was launched in 2019|\n|If renewable power prices are falling, isn’t electrification better?|Direct electrification using renewable power has lower system losses than power-to-hydrogen-to-power|We see green hydrogen being used primarily in harder to abate sectors, not as an alternative to electrification|\n|Aren't batteries better?|Batteries are a cheaper alternative for electrification, and auto companies seem to be mainly backing batteries, not hydrogen. Elon Musk’s “Fool cells” remark is widely quoted|We see hydrogen as being most successful where batteries are not viable; Citi's auto team, for example, do not expect passenger cars to be a major end market for hydrogen, and this is not a major driver of our thesis. Hydrogen costs are falling, however, and in certain applications (long-distance transportation or where short recharge/refuel times are needed), hydrogen has significant advantages over battery technology, and is already being adopted in niche areas like forklift trucks and distributed power gen in data centres|\n|What about policy risk?|Green hydrogen is not currently economically viable, and without policy support investment could collapse|We’ve seen other markets develop this way, for example in solar and wind. Policy-driven markets have different risks than typical supply/demand, but can still be a success|", 'metadata': {'source': <Source.equity_research: 'equity_research'>, 'type': <Type.table: 'table'>, 'publisher': 'Citi Research', 'url': 'process/process_pdf_tables/data/test.pdf/5', 'created_at': '1600214400.0', 'author': None, 'title': 'Figure 1.

Addressing the sceptics’ view\n\n|Topic|Sceptics' view|Citi view|\n|---|---|---|\n|Haven’t we been here before?|Hydrogen has been touted as the fuel of the future multiple times over the last century, but has never taken off in any significant way. What's different this time?|Significant support from government policy, notably the EU target for 80GW of electrolyser capacity by 2030, points to government backing that has not previously been in place. Significant investment have also been announced in other regions|\n|Aren't costs prohibitive?|Green hydrogen costs at US$3-6kg+ are prohibitive, blue hydrogen (using carbon capture) can be half this price but still not yet cost competitive with grey (unabated fossil fuel derived) hydrogen at ~US$1-2/kg\nGreen hydrogen costs are already 50% down since 2015, and cheaper renewables pricing and falling electrolyser costs, driven by volumes, should drive costs lower. The EC targets a price of €1-2/kg by 2030. The history of other technologies (wind, solar) show that the combination of higher volumes and government incentives can drive costs down faster than is often expected at the outset. A Hydrogen council report estimates that green hydrogen could be cost competitive with grey hydrogen by 2030|\n|If power prices need to fall significantly, who will invest in the renewable power infrastructure?|Since electricity is the major cost component of green hydrogen, cheap (or free) electricity will be needed to drive down the price of green hydrogen, removing the incentive to invest in the required wind and solar in the first place\nRenewables costs are falling already - Iberdrola sees onshore wind LCOE down 30% and offshore LCOE down 40% by 2030 – and other drivers like falling electrolyser costs (which we see down 60% by 2030) and higher system efficiency also play a role. Hydrogen Europe sees green hydrogen at €1-2/kg possible at power prices of €15-30/MWh. Areas with the cheapest renewable resources (US, Australia, Middle East) have significant cost advantages for hydrogen production compared to regions like Japan or South Korea|\n|What about the infrastructure?|Transportation and storage costs are prohibitive for anything other than on-site hydrogen production|Hydrogen could share the existing natural gas network to some extent. Small scale transportation by truck is already viable for niche applications. For long-distance, the first liquefied hydrogen carrier ship was launched in 2019|\n|If renewable power prices are falling, isn’t electrification better?|Direct electrification using renewable power has lower system losses than power-to-hydrogen-to-power|We see green hydrogen being used primarily in harder to abate sectors, not as an alternative to electrification|\n|Aren't batteries better?|Batteries are a cheaper alternative for electrification, and auto companies seem to be mainly backing batteries, not hydrogen. Elon Musk’s “Fool cells” remark is widely quoted|We see hydrogen as being most successful where batteries are not viable; Citi's auto team, for example, do not expect passenger cars to be a major end market for hydrogen, and this is not a major driver of our thesis. Hydrogen costs are falling, however, and in certain applications (long-distance transportation or where short recharge/refuel times are needed), hydrogen has significant advantages over battery technology, and is already being adopted in niche areas like forklift trucks and distributed power gen in data centres|\n|What about policy risk?|Green hydrogen is not currently economically viable, and without policy support investment could collapse|We’ve seen other markets develop this way, for example in solar and wind. Policy-driven markets have different risks than typical supply/demand, but can still be a success|", 'metadata': {'source': <Source.equity_research: 'equity_research'>, 'type': <Type.table: 'table'>, 'publisher': 'Citi Research', 'url': 'process/process_pdf_tables/data/test.pdf/5', 'created_at': '1600214400.0', 'author': None, 'title': 'Figure 1.

Addressing the sceptics’ view\\n\\n|Topic|Sceptics\' view|Citi view|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Haven’t we been here before?|Hydrogen has been touted as the fuel of the future multiple times over the last century, but has never taken off in any significant way. What\'s different this time?|Significant support from government policy, notably the EU target for 80GW of electrolyser capacity by 2030, points to government backing that has not previously been in place. Significant investment have also been announced in other regions|\\n|Aren\'t costs prohibitive?|Green hydrogen costs at US$3-6kg+ are prohibitive, blue hydrogen (using carbon capture) can be half this price but still not yet cost competitive with grey (unabated fossil fuel derived) hydrogen at ~US$1-2/kg\\nGreen hydrogen costs are already 50% down since 2015, and cheaper renewables pricing and falling electrolyser costs, driven by volumes, should drive costs lower. The EC targets a price of €1-2/kg by 2030. The history of other technologies (wind, solar) show that the combination of higher volumes and government incentives can drive costs down faster than is often expected at the outset. A Hydrogen council report estimates that green hydrogen could be cost competitive with grey hydrogen by 2030|\\n|If power prices need to fall significantly, who will invest in the renewable power infrastructure?|Since electricity is the major cost component of green hydrogen, cheap (or free) electricity will be needed to drive down the price of green hydrogen, removing the incentive to invest in the required wind and solar in the first place\\nRenewables costs are falling already - Iberdrola sees onshore wind LCOE down 30% and offshore LCOE down 40% by 2030 – and other drivers like falling electrolyser costs (which we see down 60% by 2030) and higher system efficiency also play a role. Hydrogen Europe sees green hydrogen at €1-2/kg possible at power prices of €15-30/MWh. Areas with the cheapest renewable resources (US, Australia, Middle East) have significant cost advantages for hydrogen production compared to regions like Japan or South Korea|\\n|What about the infrastructure?|Transportation and storage costs are prohibitive for anything other than on-site hydrogen production|Hydrogen could share the existing natural gas network to some extent. Small scale transportation by truck is already viable for niche applications. For long-distance, the first liquefied hydrogen carrier ship was launched in 2019|\\n|If renewable power prices are falling, isn’t electrification better?|Direct electrification using renewable power has lower system losses than power-to-hydrogen-to-power|We see green hydrogen being used primarily in harder to abate sectors, not as an alternative to electrification|\\n|Aren\'t batteries better?|Batteries are a cheaper alternative for electrification, and auto companies seem to be mainly backing batteries, not hydrogen. Elon Musk’s “Fool cells” remark is widely quoted|We see hydrogen as being most successful where batteries are not viable; Citi\'s auto team, for example, do not expect passenger cars to be a major end market for hydrogen, and this is not a major driver of our thesis. Hydrogen costs are falling, however, and in certain applications (long-distance transportation or where short recharge/refuel times are needed), hydrogen has significant advantages over battery technology, and is already being adopted in niche areas like forklift trucks and distributed power gen in data centres|\\n|What about policy risk?|Green hydrogen is not currently economically viable, and without policy support investment could collapse|We’ve seen other markets develop this way, for example in solar and wind. Policy-driven markets have different risks than typical supply/demand, but can still be a success|"]"""'}] | Processing Time: 23.327701415866613 | Response: {

What's different this time?|Significant support from government policy, notably the EU target for 80GW of electrolyser capacity by 2030, points to government backing that has not previously been in place. Significant investment have also been announced in other regions|\n|Aren't costs prohibitive?|Green hydrogen costs at US$3-6kg+ are prohibitive, blue hydrogen (using carbon capture) can be half this price but still not yet cost competitive with grey (unabated fossil fuel derived) hydrogen at ~US$1-2/kg\nGreen hydrogen costs are already 50% down since 2015, and cheaper renewables pricing and falling electrolyser costs, driven by volumes, should drive costs lower. The EC targets a price of €1-2/kg by 2030. The history of other technologies (wind, solar) show that the combination of higher volumes and government incentives can drive costs down faster than is often expected at the outset. A Hydrogen council report estimates that green hydrogen could be cost competitive with grey hydrogen by 2030|\n|If power prices need to fall significantly, who will invest in the renewable power infrastructure?|Since electricity is the major cost component of green hydrogen, cheap (or free) electricity will be needed to drive down the price of green hydrogen, removing the incentive to invest in the required wind and solar in the first place\nRenewables costs are falling already - Iberdrola sees onshore wind LCOE down 30% and offshore LCOE down 40% by 2030 – and other drivers like falling electrolyser costs (which we see down 60% by 2030) and higher system efficiency also play a role.

Elon Musk’s “Fool cells” remark is widely quoted|We see hydrogen as being most successful where batteries are not viable; Citi's auto team, for example, do not expect passenger cars to be a major end market for hydrogen, and this is not a major driver of our thesis. Hydrogen costs are falling, however, and in certain applications (long-distance transportation or where short recharge/refuel times are needed), hydrogen has significant advantages over battery technology, and is already being adopted in niche areas like forklift trucks and distributed power gen in data centres|\n|What about policy risk?|Green hydrogen is not currently economically viable, and without policy support investment could collapse|We’ve seen other markets develop this way, for example in solar and wind.

One way to estimate this effect is to look at what is required to meet the EU's 2030 target for electrolysis capacity of 40 GW.\n\nAssuming that 67% of the extra electricity needed to power these electrolysers will come from offshore wind, as opposed to other renewables such as solar in Spain, we estimate that this plan will require around 21 GW of offshore wind over the next decade.

The EC targets a price of €1-2/kg by 2030. The history of other technologies (wind, solar) show that the combination of higher volumes and government incentives can drive costs down faster than is often expected at the outset. A Hydrogen council report estimates that green hydrogen could be cost competitive with grey hydrogen by 2030|\n|If power prices need to fall significantly, who will invest in the renewable power infrastructure?|Since electricity is the major cost component of green hydrogen, cheap (or free) electricity will be needed to drive down the price of green hydrogen, removing the incentive to invest in the required wind and solar in the first place\nRenewables costs are falling already - Iberdrola sees onshore wind LCOE down 30% and offshore LCOE down 40% by 2030 – and other drivers like falling electrolyser costs (which we see down 60% by 2030) and higher system efficiency also play a role.

Elon Musk’s “Fool cells” remark is widely quoted|We see hydrogen as being most successful where batteries are not viable; Citi's auto team, for example, do not expect passenger cars to be a major end market for hydrogen, and this is not a major driver of our thesis. Hydrogen costs are falling, however, and in certain applications (long-distance transportation or where short recharge/refuel times are needed), hydrogen has significant advantages over battery technology, and is already being adopted in niche areas like forklift trucks and distributed power gen in data centres|\n|What about policy risk?|Green hydrogen is not currently economically viable, and without policy support investment could collapse|We’ve seen other markets develop this way, for example in solar and wind.

One way to estimate this effect is to look at what is required to meet the EU's 2030 target for electrolysis capacity of 40 GW.\n\nAssuming that 67% of the extra electricity needed to power these electrolysers will come from offshore wind, as opposed to other renewables such as solar in Spain, we estimate that this plan will require around 21 GW of offshore wind over the next decade.

Thus it is difficult to distinguish between what extra capacity will be built because of the development of hydrogen versus what would have gone ahead anyway. One way to estimate this effect is to look at what is required to meet the EU's 2030 target for electrolysis capacity of 40 GW.\n\nAssuming that 67% of the extra electricity needed to power these electrolysers will come from offshore wind, as opposed to other renewables such as solar in Spain, we estimate that this plan will require around 21 GW of offshore wind over the next decade.
