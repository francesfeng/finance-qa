The strategy is built on four pillars: 

Positioning Belgium as an import and transit hub in Europe. The country will remain dependent on energy imports in various forms to cover its domestic demand, estimating between 2 and 6 TWh of renewable hydrogen (or derivatives) in 2030 and between 100 and 165 TWh in 2050. In this context, two conditions are essential: certification scheme for RFNBOs and agreements with EU and extra-EU partners.

Becoming a leader in hydrogen technologies. To strengthen the leading position in hydrogen technologies, the Energy Transition Fund will continue to operate until 2025 to provide 20 to 30 million euros in support funding. In addition, the federal government has allocated a budget of 60 million euros (including 50 million euros from the national recovery and resilience plan) to support various projects to scale up promising technologies.

Establishing a robust hydrogen market. The federal government plan to pursue the development of a hydrogen transport infrastructure by open-access pipeline. A first phase will be started by the commissioning of minimum 100 to 160km pipelines for H2 transport by 2026, partly supported by a budget of 95 million euros in the context of the national recovery and resilience plan. By 2030, Belgium has the ambition to connect the import hub to neighbouring countries via the open-access hydrogen network in order to realise its international positioning as an import and transit hub for renewable energy in Europe.

This Directive set out minimum requirements for the building-up of alternative fuels infrastructure, including recharging points for electric vehicles and refuelling points for natural gas (LNG and CNG) and hydrogen, to be implemented by means of Member States' national policy frameworks, as well as common technical specifications for such recharging and refuelling points, and user information requirements.This has now been repealed so it can be updated to eventually become a regulation instead of a directive.The new updated proposal for an Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) will be considered by the European Parliament and Council (and possibly amended) before being promulgated. In December 2019, the Commission adopted the European Green Deal communication . The European Green Deal calls for a 90% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in transport. The aim is for the EU to become a climate-neutral economy by 2050, while also working towards a zero-pollution ambition. In September 2020, the Commission adopted its proposal for a European Climate Law to reduce net emissions of greenhouse gases by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 and to put Europe on a responsible path to becoming climate-neutral by 2050.   In December 2020, the Commission adopted the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy communication ).

The group undertook a study over the period from November 2020 to July 2021. The task force is part of the government’s Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution, launched by the Prime Minister in November 2020. The plan directs GBP 12 billion in government funding, covering the energy, transport and industry sectors, to support a green recovery and support job creation. Specifically, the plan is expected to support the creation of up to 250 000 green jobs – including engineers, fitters, construction workers among many others – by 2030. Sectors for new investment include offshore wind, hydrogen, advanced nuclear, zero emissions vehicles, green buildings and CCUS. The strategy builds off the Lifetime Skills Guarantee, announced by the government in September 2020, which aims to better align the post-16 education system with company needs in order to set up workers to meet the skills gaps of today and the future, in sectors such as construction, digital, clean energy and manufacturing. In early 2021, the programme launched almost 400 qualifications that are fully-funded for any adult who has not already achieved a Level 3 qualification. The 15 final recommendations of the Green Jobs Task Force – divided along three themes of the ‘green jobs lifecycle’ – are meant to support the government’s ambition for two million green jobs in the United Kingdom by 2030 and help establish the workforce pathway to net zero emissions by 2050. It notes research commissioned by the Climate Change Commission that found that overall the United Kingdom’s transition to net zero emissions will increase GDP by around 2- 3%, and create about 300 000 additional jobs by 2050. The green jobs lifecycle is defined as employment in an activity that either directly or indirectly contributes to the United Kingdom’s net zero emissions target and mitigates climate risks, and therefore covers a broad range of economic sectors. It builds upon reforms to the skills system established under the government’s Skills for Jobs White Paper that introduced new T Levels technical qualifications, flexible apprenticeships, Skills Bootcamps and occupational traineeships.  The task force’s report notes that one in five jobs in the United Kingdom (6.3 million workers) will require skills that may see increased demand (10% of UK jobs) or reduced demand (approximately 10%) as a result of the net zero transition. The report also includes estimates of job creation potential in various clean energy sectors (such as offshore wind and buildings retrofits) as well as jobs and skills shifts in sectors experiencing significant transformation (such as automotive).  For example, on a sectoral basis, the offshore wind sector is poised for major growth. Based on industry estimates, the sector could employ 40 000 directly and an additional 30 000 through the supply chain, relative to around 26 000 today. These jobs will be concentrated in construction, installation, operations and maintenance, requiring technicians and engineers, in particular. Nonetheless, a broad set of skills is needed for ongoing sectoral development, including asset management, project management, engineering and technical skills, science, advanced first aid and rescue, and offshore-specific skills. A number of these skills are particularly well-suited for current oil and gas sector workers. Similarly, some of the skills gaps in CCUS and hydrogen could be met with the current oil and gas workforce, such as pipe fitters and designers, leak test technicians, and offshore barge operators. The United Kingdom’s offshore oil and gas sector, notably, has been an important pillar of the country’s economy and energy security for many decades, and will face significant change on the path to net zero. It is estimated that the sector supports around 260 000 jobs, including 147 000 direct and supply chain jobs.Already, between 2014 and 2017, the UK oil and gas sector lost over 70 000 direct and supply chain. Another 80 000 workers are predicted to lose their jobs in the sector between 2018 and 2035.  However, over 90% of the United Kingdom’s oil and gas workforce have medium to high skills transferability so can be suitable to work in other energy sectors, including decommissioning and subsea network projects, offshore wind, CCUS and hydrogen.  The offshore oil and gas industry has supported the United Kingdom’s target to reach net zero emissions by 2050 based on the sector’s Roadmap 2035. This includes a focus on developing people and skills with a commitment to a diverse workforce with transferable skills and to support 130 000 jobs across the energy sector. It also commits the industry to becoming a global leader in carbon management through by fostering knowledge, skills, innovation and capabilities. Key actions will include upskilling workers on the UK Continental Shelf, developing of a plan for a more flexible, multi-skilled and technology-enabled workforce, and ensuring diversity that reflects broader society.  As part of the government’s climate change strategy, it also reached an agreement with the North Sea oil and gas industry to manage the economic transition and transformation of the region. The North Sea Transition Deal includes public and private investments of up to GBP 14-16 billion by 2030 in clean energy technologies, a voluntary commitment by the sector to source 50% local content for energy transition projects by 2030, and support for up to 40 000 direct and indirect jobs as part of efforts to decarbonise offshore oil and gas production.  The commitment to employment will include reskilling of the existing oil and gas workforce. Technologies that will be promoted based on existing skills, infrastructure and expertise in the North Sea include CCUS, hydrogen and offshore wind. The agreement notes that sectors such as offshore renewables, CCUS and hydrogen will rely heavily on a number of skillsets that match the profile of current oil and gas workers, such as geologists, project managers, different types of engineers, and fabricators. As such, the sector will aim to align with initiatives on workforce transition, skills, diversity and inclusion under other Sector Deals (such as the Offshore Wind Sector Deal), where synergies can be found. However, a deeper understanding of the future skills profile of the CCUS and hydrogen sectors will also be needed. Toward this end, the Energy Skills Alliance has spearheaded work on detailed mapping the energy sectors’ current capabilities and future needs through its Future Energy Skills Demand and Supply workstream. ",,,Green Jobs Taskforce,,,Green jobs in various sectors,2030,,Net zero emissions by 2050

As a result, Ordos is under enormous pressure to transition to clean power sources, while ensuring energy access and power system flexibility. The Net Zero Industrial Park planned by Envision is the first of its kind in China. It will be used to generate green hydrogen that will reduce Ordos’ coal consumption in industry (currently planning 10 x 1,000Nm3/h electrolysers), and lay the foundation for the production of synthetic biomaterials. The Park will also include an 8 GWh/year plant for energy storage and batteries, with phase one of three due to be completed at the end of 2021. A smart grid will co-ordinate the use and distribution of renewable energy. The project aims to further reduce emissions by replacing 330 000 trucks for coal transport with EV trucks. These will cut 30 million tons of GHG emissions per year, and save RMB 30 billion in operation costs. By drawing on 100% locally sourced renewable energy at 5 TWh/year (80% direct supply), the Industrial Park’s operations would be net zero.  ",,,,Net Zero Industrial Park in the cities of Ordos and Baotou,"EV trucks: 330,000 trucks for coal transport

Based on the Indian government´s pledge under the Paris Agreement to scale up renewables, it is estimated that net employment (measured in full-time employees) will increase by an additional 30% by 2030. And the International Labour Organization (ILO) forecasts that India’s shift to a green economy could add 3 million jobs in the renewables sector alone by 2030. Given the scale of the commitment, the government is attempting to move early to develop training, skills and educational programmes, as well as reskilling and upskilling initiatives.  The Skill Council for Green Jobs (SCGJ) was established in October 2015 under the aegis of the government of India’s Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, to address skilled manpower requirements for emerging climate resilient technologies and India’s commitments under the UNFCCC. The programme is backed by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy and Confederation of Indian Industry. SCGJ was set up as a non-profit, independent, industry-led organisation with a mandate to identify skilling needs in green jobs sectors and to design and implement a wide range of capacity building and skilling programmes to meet these requirements. SCGJ’s activities are linked to some of the key clean energy and industrial schemes and missions of the government of India, including the National Solar Mission, Make in India, Atmanirbhar Bharat, Swach Bharat Mission, and has been closely interacting with central ministries, including the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs and Ministry of Jal Shakti, in addition to skill missions in various states. In line with the National Education Policy 2020 of India, SCGJ is now also working towards introducing green jobs vocational education in schools, universities and engineering institutions.SCGJ’s key activities encompass all stages of training, design and delivery, and include: 

performing skills gap analysis 

occupational mapping 

development of qualification packs based on industry requirements 

 affiliating with suitable training partners and assessment agencies

training for trainers and assessors

training and certification of candidates in various subsectors

creation of centres of excellence

improving industry linkages in all sub-sectors

undertaking consultancy assignments

implementing externally sponsored projects. 

 SCGJ has a focus on three work streams – renewable energy; environment, forestry and climate change; and sustainable development – which covers the entire gamut of “green businesses” in the country.  SCGJ has so far developed 44 nationally-approved qualifications across various sub-domains (e.g. renewable energy, waste management, etc.), along with supplementing coursework and content. It has a network of over 406 affiliated institutions/centres along with over 4 000 trainers and assessors countrywide across green business domains. To-date, SCGJ through its partners have trained over 500 000 candidates, including over 100 000 in solar and other renewable energy domains. In addition, SCGJ has developed an e-learning management system through which over 4 000 candidates have received virtual training.  For example, with support from the International Solar Alliance, SCGJ has undertaken training of over 1 300 stakeholders from 82 ISA member countries across various aspects of solar energy. In addition, SCGJ implemented a range of corporate social responsibility supported projects, including on Simultaneous Intervention of Renewable Energy Systems and Skilling for Smart Model Villages, a project adopted by the president of India to create ‘smart villages’ in the state of Haryana through expanded access to clean energy and skilling. Moreover, under a project with IT company HCL, SCGJ has designed and developed training modules and implemented trainings on solid waste management best practices, health and hygiene, and communications skills, to over 4 000 field staff of the Noida Authority. To understand current and future employment of the country’s clean energy sector, SCGJ is also implementing a comprehensive mapping of the green jobs landscape in India, supported by JP Morgan Chase. As part of workforce mapping exercises, SCGJ has partnered with the Council on Energy, Environment and Water and Natural Resources Defense Council to undertake an annual review of jobs and skilling in the Indian solar and wind energy industry. SCGJ’s industry-led skilling programmes are designed to include advanced technological interventions that are harmonised with industry standards and requirements. As part of these efforts, SCGJ partners with key national institutions and industry to leverage their expertise and strengths in various subsectors. SCGJ’s vision to 2047 sees the shift to clean energy resulting in 30-35 million additional jobs created across a number of sectors by the end of the period, with over 10 million skills trainings and job facilitations undertaken. The sectors deemed to have the highest potential for job creation include green hydrogen, energy storage, hybrid renewable systems, biomass/biofuels, EV charging, pollution control, e-waste management, and decarbonisation of energy intensive industries. By 2030, SCGJ aims to facilitate training one million candidates in clean energy and green technologies and two million via virtual or blended upskilling and reskilling training across all sectors, establish 20 centres of excellence along with 750 affiliated training centres, and certify 7 500 trainers across the country. ",,,Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE),,"renewable energy: 175 GW by 2022 (2022)

It provides for a simplified licensing regime for local grid connected, low-voltage, small/residential renewable energy producers. Any entity that has a contract for purchasing electricity can be a producer of electricity from renewable energy sources, covering solar, wind, hydro, cogeneration, biomass, and fuel cells using hydrogen from renewable energy microproduction. Licensing is conducted through the internet, via the System of Registration of Microproducers (SRM), an electronic platform through with producers register their installations. Micro producers cannot inject more than 50 % of the power mentioned in the purchasing contract, limited to 3.68 kW, except in the case of installations for condominiums. There are two types of feed-in tariffs: General Regime - The tariff is equal to the cost of electricity sold under the purchasing contract Bonified Tariff - a special reference tariff is defined during the first 5 years following the installation. The reference tariff for the first 10 MW installed is defined as EUR 650/MWh and decreases 5 % for each additional 10 MW registered in the SRM. The reference tariff applies differently depending on the renewable energy technology used. It is 100% for solar (i.e., the full EUR 650/MWh), 70% for wind, 30% for hydro, cogeneration and biomass. For fuel cells, the tariff is the one that applies to the renewable energy source used for hydrogen production. As of October 2010, the Decree Law 118-A/2010 modifies some aspects of Microgeneration Law DL 363/2007 . This amendment intends to support the generation of electricity from renewable sources in Low voltage systems by simplifying the application procedure. The new regulation increases the annual ceiling for installation to 25 MW per year and streamlines the access to the Micro Production regime for public, social, education, defense and local institutions. Moreover, the Bonified Regime is adjusted to the cost of equipments used in the Micro production and can only be accesssed under certain conditions, namely the compliance with energy efficiency measures and the use of solar thermal collectors or biomass boilers.

These are to be reached via linear phasing, with concrete measures set for meeting the targets.  By 2011, 20% of gross energy consumption must come from renewable energy sources.The agreement includes better terms for wind turbines and other sustainable energy sources such as biomass and bio gas.Aside from significantly raising the transfer rate for electricity from land wind turbines, biomass and bio gas, the parties agree to install 400 MW from new offshore wind turbines by 2012. Plans to invest in two new 75 MW land-based facilities in 2010 and 2011 have also been announced.The deal also provides  incentives and a compensation scheme for local residents to allow land-based wind farms  to be located in their area, including a new stakeholder model.In addition, 25 million DKK per year for the next five years has been earmarked for wave and solar power  research.The effort to save energy is being considerably ramped up:  The new agreement commits Denmark to cut its energy consumption by 2% by 2012, compared with 2006 levels.  This is half a percentage point more than Denmarks current target, meaning that in 2020, energy use must have fallen by 4% compared to 2006.Hydrogen vehicles are to be tax-free  and the same applies to electric vehicles provisionally until 2012, and a pool of 35 million DKK is being set aside for electric vehicle research. The government and Danish Peoples Party would like a significant increase in research, development and demonstration efforts in energy technology to the amount of 750 million DKK in 2009 and 1 billion DKK from 2010, and this will be taken up in connection with the implementation of globalisation funding.In the case of significant deviations for the linear phasing of renewable energy and energy savings targets, the parties (Danish government and parliament) shall discuss supplementary initiatives for attaining the targets.The parties behind the agreement will receive a status report on development toward the goals and implement analyses up until 2011. By the end of 2010 it will be determined whether there is a need for implementing further initiatives.",,,Danish government,,,,,2008-2011,

The new FutureGen approach proposes federal funding to demonstrate cutting-edge CCS technology at multiple commercial-scale integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) or advanced coal power plants, and it includes engagement with the international community. The restructured approach will focus on separating carbon dioxide for CCS, and does not include hydrogen production. The project will support the continuation of an advanced coal gasification-based CCS project through the completion of final detailed design, construction and shakedown testing, start-up and full scale operations and CO2 storage and post-injection site monitoring. Start-up of the FutureGen facility is expected to begin in November 2014. The FutureGen Alliance leads the FutureGen project. The Alliance is a public-private partnership to design, build, and operate the first commercial coal-fueled, near-zero emissions power plant. The Alliance, with support from DOE, will pursue options to raise additional non-federal funds needed to build and operate the facility. Members of the Alliance include some of the largest coal producers and users in the world. These members share the cost and risk of developing the advanced technologies necessary to commercialize the FutureGen concept and will contribute nearly USD 400 million toward the projects costs. The Alliance will also bring technical expertise and industrial project management experience to the project.",,,,FutureGen project,,,,,

The initiative is part of the CUTE (Clean Urban Transport for Europe) demonstration project funded under the Fifth Framework Programme for Research and Development.  Hydrogen is an efficient and environment-friendly power source, which the Commission is committed to promote as part of its plan to foster the use of alternative fuels in transport. This fuel-cell bus project will be the first volume-production test of this scale conducted worldwide. The Energy and Transport Directorate-General of the European Commission has committed one of the largest funds ever to this demonstration project. The buses will be delivered to the cities during the year 2003.  The performance of the bus is comparable to conventional diesel-driven buses and each can accommodate up to 70 passengers. Each of the bus operators will build a filling station for gaseous hydrogen. Fuel producers are partners in the creation of the hydrogen infrastructure, some of whom will subsequently operate the filling stations so as to gain experience with alternative fuels themselves. Hydrogen will be produced through different methods in order to provide data for an efficiency comparison. The buses operation within the CUTE project finished in December 2005.

331,Differentiated levy on heavy duty traffic,Switzerland,2001,In force,National,Energy Efficiency,"Payments, finance and taxation, Taxes, fees and charges, Vehicle registration tax, Product taxation","Transport, Road transport","Road vehicles, Heavy trucks, Transport technologies","Heavy duty vehicles pay a levy per km which varies regarding EURO-emission standard. Electric and hydrogen HDV are exempted from the tax. The ultimate goal of the policy is to internalize all external cost of heavy duty transport transiting the Swiss alps and to incentivize the shift to train cargo.  The heavy-duty (> 3.5 tonnes) vehicle fee (HVF) was introduced in 2001. Its prime goal is to internalise external road transport costs. The HVF is calculated on distance, weight and emissions standards, replacing a previous flat fee. Its initial rate was CHF 0.017/tonne/km, rising to CHF 0.025/tonne/km as from 1.1.2005; it will level off at a maximum CHF 0.0275/tonne/km in 2008. Parallel to the rate increases, the maximum lorry weight was lifted to 34 tonnes in 2001 and to 40 tonnes in 2005. This gradual approach gave hauliers time to improve productivity, which partly offset the cost of the HVF. In the first four years since the introduction of the HVF road transport costs have increased by some 6%. Two-thirds of HVF revenues are allocated to construction of rail infrastructure (including two trans-Alpine railway tunnels) to support modal shift. Annual revenues ranged between CHF 800-900 million (EUR 515-580 million) in the first four years and rose to some CHF 1.3 billion (EUR 840 million) in 2005. The HVF resulted from protracted bilateral transport negotiations with the EU. Switzerland was concerned that the lifting of the then prevailing 28- tonne limit on lorries, as demanded by the EU, would unleash massive transit traffic and seriously jeopardize constitutionally mandated modal shift and sustainability policies. The introduction of the HVF was approved by a 57% majority of the Swiss people in 1998. The effects of the HVF (as well as higher truck load limitations) are compelling. Freight mileage decreased 8% in 2001-04 after decade-long uninterrupted growth, while transported freight volumes actually increased. There was virtually no traffic rerouting through neighbouring countries. Transit mileage through the Alps decreased 8%. The decline was the steepest in the first two years due to fleet modernisation and efficiency gains. Provisional data for 2005 indicates a -3% mileage decline because of the rate increase. Modelling indicates that by 2007 CO2 emissions from road freight transport will be 6-8% below what would have happened without the new regime with HVF and higher weight limit. The main effects on transit are expected when high-performance modal shift infrastructure will become operational. Long-term, road freight mileage growth will resume in Switzerland, because of overall European transport trends, albeit more moderately than in the past. However, the share of rail transport in Switzerland is expected to grow from currently 39% to 47% by 2030, thereby reversing past trends.  The current rates are 0.0031 CHF/tkm for Euro 3 trucks and below, 0.00269/tkm for Euro 4 and 5 trucks and 0.0026 CHF/tkm for Euro 6 trucks.",,,,,,,,,

337,Norway’s electric vehicle incentives,Norway,1990,In force,National,People-Centred Transitions,"Climate change strategies, Equity, Information campaigns",,,"Norway has gradually introduced incentives for zero-emissions vehicles since the 1990s and currently has a target stating that 100% of new passenger cars and light goods vehicles sold be zero-emissions (electric or hydrogen) by 2025. The incentives were wide-ranging to stimulate consumer uptake. Tax incentives include a progressive tax on vehicles based on their weight and emissions, which makes EVs more economical for consumers. EVs are not only exempt from emissions taxes, but also from a VAT on purchases and leases. In addition, the government incentivises demand for EVs through exemptions or a minimum 50% reduction in road taxes and tolls. Moreover, incentives for EVs also include lower parking fees and access to bus lanes, all of which are designed to increase the consumer appeal of EVs over fossil fuel-based vehicles. Based on the effect of the incentives currently in place, Norway expects to achieve its EV target through promoting a shift in consumer preferences toward EVs, without imposing an official ban on the sale of fossil fuel vehicles. As a result of the incentives, over 60% of new vehicles sold in Norway so far in 2021 were electric, bringing the total EV vehicle fleet to more than 400 000 cars. ",,,,,,,2025,,
